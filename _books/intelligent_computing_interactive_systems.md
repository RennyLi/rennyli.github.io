I am currently reading this comprehensive book on intelligent computing for interactive system design. This book appears to be highly relevant to my research interests in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and interactive system design.

## Initial Thoughts

As I'm still in the early stages of reading this book, I'll update this review as I progress through the chapters. The book seems to cover fundamental concepts in intelligent computing and how they can be applied to create more effective and user-friendly interactive systems.

## Why I Chose This Book

Given my background in HCI research and my current work in the field, this book seems like an essential read to understand the latest developments in intelligent computing as they relate to interactive system design. It should provide valuable insights for my research in Human-Computer Interaction.

*Review will be updated as I continue reading...*
