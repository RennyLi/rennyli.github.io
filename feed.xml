Instead, what I found was a deeper conversation: about trust, responsibility, and the human dimensions that technology can’t (and shouldn’t) replace.</p> <h2 id="what-i-used-to-think-the-promise-of-ai-in-healthcare">What I Used to Think: The Promise of AI in Healthcare</h2> <p>Before watching this video, I already believed that generative AI could play a major role in healthcare. For example, I had read research on AI chatbots used in mental health scenarios — offering patients conversational comfort and basic coping guidance. I also saw firsthand how my father, who is currently undergoing chemotherapy, uses tools like DeepSeek or ChatGPT to understand complex medical reports, drug instructions, and treatment options. These tools help demystify medical jargon in ways that feel empowering.</p> <p>To me, this is what makes healthcare such a meaningful domain for AI — because it touches every life.</p> <p>Still, I had concerns. ChatGPT and similar tools are not always reliable. They hallucinate. They make things up. I wasn’t sure how we could reconcile this unreliability with the life-and-death nature of medicine.</p> <h2 id="why-cant-doctors-use-it-freely">Why Can’t Doctors Use It Freely?</h2> <p>The host Justin Norden raised a great question in the slides: why are so many healthcare professionals restricted from using AI tools? He called it a “weird phenomenon,” and I agree. It seems paradoxical — we have powerful tools, but the people who might benefit most can’t touch them.</p> <p>In my view, there are two main reasons for this:</p> <p><strong>First, the underlying knowledge base of these models hasn’t been fully validated.</strong> No hospital wants to base treatment decisions on potentially flawed data.</p> <p><strong>Second, there’s no system-wide training in place.</strong> Most doctors aren’t trained in how to use or even critically evaluate generative AI tools. Without that structure, adoption remains slow.</p> <p>So despite all the excitement, practical deployment lags far behind.</p> <h2 id="ferrari-in-traffic-where-gen-ai-helps--and-where-it-cant">Ferrari in Traffic? Where Gen AI Helps — and Where It Can’t</h2> <blockquote> <p><em>“You could put a Ferrari in rush hour traffic on the 101… but would it get you there faster?”</em> <em>— Troy Tazbaz</em></p> </blockquote> <p>This analogy hit home. AI is powerful, yes — but without the right environment, it doesn’t shine.</p> <p>Where AI <strong>does</strong> shine, I believe, is in <strong>information retrieval and explanation</strong>. It never forgets. It has an endless memory and can access a vast array of medical knowledge in seconds. In that sense, it might even outperform a human in helping patients understand their diagnosis, medications, or follow-up procedures.</p> <p>It also has psychological advantages. In mental health support, some people may feel more comfortable opening up to a bot than to a real human. AI can be tireless, available 24/7, and free from human judgment.</p> <p>But no matter how good AI gets, <strong>there are things it can’t do.</strong> It doesn’t have the warmth of a human being. It doesn’t touch your shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be okay. It doesn’t perform surgery — at least, not yet. And when it comes to decisions where life is at stake, we still want to look into another person’s eyes.</p> <p>Maybe it’s because AI is still a tool. And when it really matters, we trust humans more.</p> <h2 id="toward-human-centered-intelligence">Toward Human-Centered Intelligence</h2> <p>If generative AI is a river — constantly changing, constantly moving — how do we safely navigate it?</p> <p>I believe the future lies in <strong>human-centered intelligence</strong> — where people remain at the center of the loop. In the new HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), it’s not about replacing humans, but augmenting them. Human + AI, learning and correcting one another iteratively.</p> <p>One potential path forward is to <strong>build structured pipelines</strong>. For example, an AI could generate a medical recommendation, which is then reviewed by a trained expert before reaching the patient. Yes, it adds human cost. But for now, it may be the most trustworthy way.</p> <p>In this fast-moving era, we don’t need to rush to full automation. What we need is thoughtful integration — balancing innovation with responsibility, and remembering always that the ultimate goal is not to impress, but to heal.</p> <p>Let the river flow — but let humans steer the boat.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra</title><link href="https://rennyli.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra"/><published>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://rennyli.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://rennyli.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/"><![CDATA[<p>May 14, 2024[[read-time]] min read We’re introducing a series of updates across the Gemini family of models, including the new 1.5 Flash, our lightweight model for speed and efficiency, and Project Astra, our vision for the future of AI assistants. In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
