Hello! I’m Jingquan Li, or you can call me Renny. You can also <a href="https://www.name-coach.com/jingquan-li" target="_blank">hear how to pronounce my name</a>. I’m an first year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Merced, advised by <a href="https://www.asarif.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Ahmed Sabbir Arif</a>. My research interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

I graduated with a B.Eng. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en" target="_blank">The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/498" target="_blank">Prof. Haizhou Li</a> in the C3 Lab. During my undergraduate studies, I also conducted research with <a href="https://www.sribd.cn/en/teacher/28" target="_blank">Prof. Xiang Wan</a> at the Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8NN-2uYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Pengcheng An</a> at SUSTech, and <a href="https://www.suat-sz.edu.cn/info/1166/1788.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Gang Cao</a> at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology.

Outside academia, I’m a passionate drummer and music lover—especially fond of metalcore and post-rock. [Bring Me The Horizon](https://www.bmthofficial.com/) and [toe](https://www.toe.st/) are among my favorites.
